# @jambon/router

``` bash
npm install @jambon/router
```

## API

### path

``` javascript
function path(path: string, ...reducers: (async state => state)[]) : async state => state
```

Import `path` function:

``` javascript
import {path} from 'jambon-router'
```

Match requests where path starts with `/api`:

``` javascript
const reducer = path('/api', ...reducers});
```

Match requests where path is exactly `/api/foos`:

``` javascript
const reducer = path('/api/foos$', async (state) => {
    const foos = await getFoos();

    return {
        ...state,
        response: {
            ...state.response,
            body: foos,
            statusCode: 200
        }
    };
});
```

Using params:

``` javascript
const reducer = path('/api/foos/:fooId$',  async (state) => {
    const {fooId} = state.request.params;
    const foo = await findFoo(fooId);

    return {
        ...state,
        response: {
            ...state.response,
            body: foo,
            statusCode: foo ? 200 : 404
        }
    };
});
```
